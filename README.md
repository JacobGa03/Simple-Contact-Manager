# Small-Contact-Manager

Source code for a small contact manager. This project was part of COP 4331C (Processes for Object-Oriented Software Development) at the University of Central Florida. The application utilizes a LAMP stack for its basic components.

# Technology Utilized

As stated, a LAMP stack was used as the foundation of this web app. Digital Ocean was used to host the website on a VM. 

The front end was done completely in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. PHP was used to write the endpoints. This allowed for smooth communication between the front end and the database.
MySQL was used as the database. The relational database stores each of the users in a table and each of their contacts in a separate table. These two tables are related through id which relates to which users own which contacts.
