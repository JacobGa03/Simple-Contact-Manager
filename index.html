            <p>
                This project was made as part of COP 4331C. This contact manager demonstrates the use of the CRUD operations. 
                The project was broken up into 3 sections: Frontend, API, and database. 

                The frontend was done completely in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                PHP was used as a backend language and allowed from communication between the frontend and database. 
                MySQL was used as the database. This database stores tables of Users and Contacts, the two are related through an id which links
                a User to their associated Contacts.
            </p>
